 * ["Host and infectivity prediction of Wuhan 2019 novel coronavirus using deep learning algorithm"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_hipwncdla.pdf)
    * Using deep learning algorithms, this article builds a virus host prediction model in order to predict the potential virus hosts. The built model suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially SARS and MERS. Additionally, by comparing predicted infectivity patterns, bat coronaviruses are  assigned  with  more  similar  infectivity  patterns  with  2019-nCoVs. It was also suggested that mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov showing that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs  of  2019-nCov.

 * ["Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for lineage B Î²-coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_facerulbbc.pdf)
    * This article shares a recent development where researchers developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, and their ability to infect cell types from different species. They found that bypassing the host protease processing barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells. These different lineage B viruses can also recombine to gain entry into human cells with human ACE2 being the receptor for 2019-nCoV.

* ["From SARS-CoV to Wuhan 2019-nCoV Outbreak: Similarity of Early Epidemic and Prediction of Future Trends"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_fswncoseep.pdf)
    * The ongoing outbreak in China caused by the 2019-nCoV is very similar in many aspects  to SARS in 2003. This article, using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the SARS outbreak, assesses and compares characteristics of these two outbreaks. Using the current data, the cumulative counts of 2019-nCoV cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of SARS, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle February. It is suggested that regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent the emergence and movement of a super-spreader.

* ["Sofosbuvir Can Inhibit the Newly Emerged Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China"](http://ghddiai.oss-cn-zhangjiakou.aliyuncs.com/file/file_scinecncwc.pdf)
    * This article aims to study the effect of anti-polymeras drugs including Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin. Sequence analysis, modeling, and dociking are used to build a model for the 2019-nCoV. The results of this study suggests that Sofobuvir, IDX-184, and Ribavirin are able to tightly bind to the newly emerged coronavirus RdRp and contradict the function of the protein. Therefore, it is likely these drugs are an effective inhibitor of this virus.

This article reports the discovery and characterization of several small-molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication through several mechanisms. It showed that their mechanisms of action revealed that the compounds act by three distinct mechanisms: (i) SSAA09E2 {*N*-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide} acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) SSAA09E1 {[(*Z*)-1-thiophen-2-ylethylideneamino]thiourea} acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) SSAA09E3 [*N*-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracen-2-yl)benzamide] also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane.
