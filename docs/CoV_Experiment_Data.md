### Unannotated preclinical studies 


* A collection of 816 records for 479 molecules from various sources. We currently don't have the capability to annotate the sources or confirm the correctness of all datasets. This dataset may contains missing values and "dirty" data. Please use the data carefully and make your own effort to confirm the data source (journals, patents, websites) and extract useful (signal) information from the set. Some datasets use standardlized value PX=-log[M].

 * Please visit [Drugbank](https://www.drugbank.ca/) to download the most recent data
   The latest release of DrugBank (version 5.1.5, released 2020-01-03) contains 13,490 drug entries including 2,636 approved small molecule drugs, 1,365 approved biologics (proteins, peptides, vaccines, and allergenics), 131 nutraceuticals and over 6,350 experimental (discovery-phase) drugs. Additionally, 5,191 non-redundant protein (i.e. drug target/enzyme/transporter/carrier) sequences are linked to these drug entries. Each entry contains more than 200 data fields with half of the information being devoted to drug/chemical data and the other half devoted to drug target or protein data.
